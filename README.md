--- UPDATE: YOU CAN SKIP DOING THIS BY USING THE LATEST EXPERIMENTAL BUILD AT YOUR OWN RISK https://github.com/timi2506/Simple-aria2cGUI-macOS/releases/tag/EXPERIMENTAL BUT MAKE SURE TO READ THE RELEASE NOTES FOR INSTRUCTIONS ---
To use this app you need to a) install aria2 using brew
(brew install aria2)
and b) make sure that aria2c (the executable of aria2) is stored in "/opt/homebrew/bin/aria2c".
you can find out where the executable is stored by typing "which aria2c"
if the file isnt stored there copy it there by executing the following command:
'sudo mkdir /opt/homebrew/bin && sudo cp -r FILEPATH /opt/homebrew/bin/'
make sure to replace FILEPATH with the Filepath that "which aria2c" returned

Also make sure to install this shortcut and dont change its name: https://github.com/timi2506/Shortcut-for-aria2cGUI/releases/latest
